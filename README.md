# Beacoverhaul

An overhaul to Minecrafts beacons, respawn anchors and lodestones.

Beacon pyramids have to be build of a consistent material, which determines the beacon effect.

<details>
<summary>List of beacon effects</summary>

- gold block -> Haste
- magma block -> Fire resistance
- sea lantern -> Night vision
- (waxed) copper block -> Jump boost
- lapis block -> True sight (highlights blocks where mobs can spawn)
- diamond block -> Extra looting (every mob death in beacon range is under the effect of extra looting levels)
- emerald block -> Player kill (every mob death in the beacon range counts as if a player killed the mob)

</details>

Respawn anchors and lodestones need to be placed on top of specific beacon pyramids in order to function.

<details>
<summary>Required pyramid for respawn anchors</summary>
Respawn anchors need a level 4 netherite block pyramid.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Required pyramid for lodestones</summary>
Lodestones need a level 4 iron block pyramid.
</details>

Additionally, respawn anchors are no longer restricted to the nether.
This is meant to replace setting the players spawn point using beds.

An overhaul for the enderchest is planned.
